          <h2>ABOUT NEWSNOW</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>NEWSNOW</strong> is more than a news outlet — it’s a movement for clarity, speed, and fearless reporting.
            Founded in Kathmandu and built for a global audience, we bring together independent thinkers, investigative journalists,
            and digital storytellers to deliver uncompromising coverage of the world’s most pressing issues.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our mission is simple: inform, engage, and empower. We chase stories that matter — from political upheavals and climate
            shifts to cultural breakthroughs and grassroots movements. We don’t just follow the news cycle; we interrogate it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every article is crafted with precision, backed by verified sources, and presented in a layout that respects your time
            and attention. We believe design is not decoration — it’s a tool for clarity.
